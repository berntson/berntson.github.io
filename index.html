                I'm a <a href="https://www.templeton.org/grant/science-engaged-philosophical-theology-god-time-and-creation">postdoc</a> at Rutgers University working on metaphysics, logic, and the philosophy of science. My PhD is from Princeton University. When not doing philosophy, I'm generally either spending time with my <a href="https://danielberntson.weebly.com/uploads/3/9/6/8/39687798/mvimg_20181216_111529__1_.jpg">family</a> or out <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/13783843">running</a> somewhere.

                <p><i>Work in progress</i> [<a href="uploads/Completeness for a new logic of conditionals.pdf" >download</a>]</p>
                <p>This papers proves completeness and decidability for B2, a new system of conditional logic that is intermediate in strength between the system B1 from Burgess (1981) and the system B3 from Lewis (1971). One of the reasons that B2 is striking is that the class of accessibilty models relative to which it is sound and complete is non-transitive. From a model-theoretic perspective, then, the system is a kind of counterfactual analogue of modal S3, with Lewis's system being the counterfactual analogue of modal S4. This paper is a technical companion to my earlier paper "The Paradox of Counterfactual Tolerance".</p>

                <p>We ordinarily think that counterfactuals are both tolerant and bounded. But from these assumptions, we can prove a flat contradiction using natural rules of counterfactual inference. Something has to go then. But what?</p>

                How should the opinion of a group be related to the opinions of the group members? In this article, we will defend a package of four norms – coherence, locality, anonymity and unanimity. Existing results show that there is no tenable procedure for aggregating outright beliefs or for aggregating credences that meet these criteria. In response, we consider the prospects for aggregating credal pairs – pairs of prior probabilities and evidence. We show that there is a method of aggregating credal pairs that possesses all four virtues.
