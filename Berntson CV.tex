%\section*{Dissertation Abstract: %\normalfont{Relational Possibility}}

\vspace{3pt}
%Turn off word splitting?

%\noindent Relational possibilities are about how things compare or otherwise relate across worlds. We might say that a pair of particles could have been farther apart than they are, for example. The usual view is that such possibilities require quantification over further things like numbers, spacetime points, or distances. The result, though, is that science would seem to be committed to more ontology---a wider range of things---than we might have otherwise thought. I develop a new view on which no such quantification is required. Modality, I say, is ultimately about how things could have \emph{differed}, not just how things could have been. Making sense of this idea means rethinking modal logic and modal metaphysics from the ground up. The result, though, is a conception of modality that not only better reflects our ordinary modal thought, but gives us powerful tools for doing science with nothing more than particles.
